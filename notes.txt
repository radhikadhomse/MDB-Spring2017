Code Issues:
Recyclerview onclick listener incomplete. Added functionality for app to display weather details by clicking cardview of city.
Cleaned up code for weather generation and parsing. Added general Util methods to automate functions like Weather object creation, etc.
Made model objects for Weather, City, etc.

Legal Issues:
added "Powered by DarkSky API" to app title.

Design issues:
"Bland" UI but this was intentional - wanted minimalistic app. Nonetheless, tweaked to get "brighter", "livelier" colors.
CardViews not working right
Issues with icon dimensions and loading icons
Color Scheme overhaul?

Dribbble designs:
Compilation of very nice weather icons

Design notes:
Went with a combination of title-icon-temperature design.
Wire view designs from dribbble for borders
